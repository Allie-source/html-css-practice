<p>We at the Pewtery Barn recognize that in these times of economic uncertainty and radically
    fluctuating savings and investment dollars that everyone is more cautious with their disposable
    income and collecting dollars. Although unadvertised, we always have been willing to work with
    any customers on mutually agreed upon lay-away plans. This note is just to say if you see an item
    that you like but are being cautious with your collecting budget, feel free to ask about a 
    <strong>confidential lay-away plan.</strong> And as always thank you for your interest in our website and 
    fine early Antique Pewter. We appreciate your business.
