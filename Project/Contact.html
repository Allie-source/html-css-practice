    <p>At Ricky’s Pawn Shop, we understand that sometimes you want an item but don’t have the cash upfront. That’s where our layaway program comes in! Here’s how it works:</p><p><strong>Find Your Item: </strong>First, browse our selection and find the item you want to purchase. Whether it’s a piece of jewelry, electronics, or something unique, we’ve got you covered.</p>
    <p><strong>10% Down Payment: </strong>Put down a 10% down payment on the item. This ensures that it will be held for you and taken off the shelf. The down payment is non-refundable but can be applied to the final purchase price. Example: Let’s say you want a handgun priced at $698.88. Your minimum down payment for layaway would be $76.17. You can choose to pay more upfront if you’d like to pay off the item faster.</p>
    <p><strong>Monthly Payments: </strong>After the down payment, you’ll need to make at least a 10% payment every month until the item is paid off. This allows you to manage your payments without a large upfront cost. And the best part? We charge NO extra fees and NO interest on layaways.</p>
    <p><strong>Flexible Timeline: </strong>Life can be unpredictable, so we give you up to 10 months to pay off the item. As long as you make the monthly payments, you’re good to go. No stress about missing deadlines!</p>
